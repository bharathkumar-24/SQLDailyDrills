Q. We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. 
Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and 
current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

Table: ms_employee_salary
id:bigint
first_name:text
last_name:text
salary:bigint
department_id:bigint

SOLUTION:

SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id,
    MAX(salary) AS current_salary
FROM
    ms_employee_salary
GROUP BY
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id
ORDER BY
    id ASC;
